## Project Description

### Overview

The encoder-decoder architecture is a fundamental framework used in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. This project provides a hands-on implementation of an encoder-decoder model using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

### Goals

- **Training**: Train an encoder-decoder model on custom datasets for sequence-to-sequence learning tasks.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using standard metrics and visualizations.
- **Encoding and Decoding**: Provide tools for encoding input sequences and decoding output sequences using the trained model.

### Features

- **Customizable Architecture**: Easily modify the encoder and decoder architecture to fit different types of sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- **Data Handling**: Includes utilities for preprocessing and handling text data, including tokenization and byte pair encoding (BPE).
- **Visualization**: Visualize model performance and predictions with built-in plotting functions.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks that guide users through the entire process, from data preparation to model training and evaluation.

### Use Cases

- **Machine Translation**: Train the model to translate text from one language to another.
- **Text Summarization**: Generate concise summaries from long-form text.
- **Sequence Generation**: Create models for generating sequences of text, such as poetry or code.

### How It Works

1. **Encoder**: The encoder processes the input sequence and compresses the information into a context vector (a fixed-size representation).
2. **Decoder**: The decoder takes the context vector and generates the output sequence step-by-step.
3. **Training**: The model is trained to minimize the difference between the predicted output sequence and the actual output sequence using a suitable loss function.

### Dependencies

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** (Choose the framework you are using)
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

## Files in the Repository

- `Trainer_0.1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training the encoder-decoder model.
- `En-decoder.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for encoding and decoding sequences.
- `vocabulary_{vocab_size}.json`: JSON file containing the vocabulary.
- `merges_{vocab_size}.json`: JSON file containing the merges information.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   \`\`\`

2. Create a virtual environment:

   \`\`\`bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use \`venv\Scripts\activate\`
   \`\`\`

3. Install the required dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Open the `Trainer_0.1.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter:

   \`\`\`bash
   jupyter notebook Trainer_0.1.ipynb
   \`\`\`

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the encoder-decoder model.

### Encoding and Decoding Sequences

1. Open the `En-decoder.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter:

   \`\`\`bash
   jupyter notebook En-decoder.ipynb
   \`\`\`

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to encode and decode sequences.

## Vocabulary and Merges

The `vocabulary_{vocab_size}.json` file contains the vocabulary used by the model, where each byte value is decoded to a UTF-8 string. The `merges_{vocab_size}.json` file contains the merges information necessary for byte pair encoding.

### Example of Vocabulary Conversion

Here is an example of how the vocabulary is converted:

\`\`\`python
import json

# Load vocabulary
with open('vocabulary_{vocab_size}.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    vocab = json.load(file)

# Display the vocabulary
print(vocab)
\`\`\`
